# Theming-Custom-Hacking-OS
Ideology for Theming

When theming a hacking OS that you didn't create, there are only two things that have to be themed, the rest should not be themed as it will be a waste of time.

1. Wallpaper (Wallpaper can be themed and changed)
2. Shell (Theme the shell as it is where you execute commands.)
3. Color Scheme (Only if easily changed like how Pop!_OS Cosmic allows you to)
