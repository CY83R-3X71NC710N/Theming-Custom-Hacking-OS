# Theming-Custom-Hacking-OS
Ideology for Theming

When theming a hacking OS that you didn't create, there are only two things that have to be themed, the rest should not be themed as it will be a waste of time. All the other customizations should be the hacking tools themselves.

1. Wallpaper (Wallpaper can be themed and changed)
2. Shell (Theme the shell as it is where you execute commands.) (I like ghostty emulator due to the extensive effects you can apply to it) (I also prefer using fish and fastfetch (as well as something similar to powerlevel10k)
3. Color Scheme (Only if easily changed like how Pop!_OS Cosmic allows you to)
